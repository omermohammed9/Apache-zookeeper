This assignment was done by me for Distributed computing; you need to have Apache Zookeeper framework installed on your device in order to run it
You need to have the necessary Jar files to avoid errors in running the code
NOTE: ANYONE CAN FEEL FREE TO MODIFY THE CODE, BUT AT LEAST LET ME BE NOTIFIED ABOUT THE MODIFICATION
